Issues:

    HAPT is a research project under development, presenting several
    known problems.  The time-varying concept integrate with HAPT is
    in a separate subdirectory: tvvd/ (standing for time-varying
    volume data).  In this directory you can find source codes to
    compile and run hapt specialized to tvvd, which is a very close
    version to the main code HAPT.  The run command is also very
    similar, for example:

    $ ./hapt turbjet

    will search for: ../tvvd/turbjet.tvvd.  Additionally, source codes
    to convert binary files p_* to the off format (under construction)
    and tvvd format (a simple time-varying format) is given.  HAPT was
    tested using the turbulent jet dataset divided in 150 binary files
    from p_01 to p_150, provided by Prof. Dr. Kwan-Liu Ma.  These
    files were converted to our tvvd internal format to simplify
    usage.

    Another issue of HAPT is the new nVidia GPUs starting from the
    GeForce 200 series.  For some unknown reason, these newest
    graphics cards are slower than the previous GeForce 8 and 9
    series.  The problem seems to be reading textures inside the
    geometry shader, which now greatly impact the performance.  We
    didn't test HAPT with better nVidia GPUs, such as Quadro or Tesla.
